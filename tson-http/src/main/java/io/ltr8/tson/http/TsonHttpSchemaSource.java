/**
 * A {@link TsonSchemaSource} that fetches a schema document over HTTP, under a host allow-list and hard caps on
 * size and time. The implementation of tson-java's own deferred "real disk/HTTP-backed {@code TsonSchemaSource}
 * with whitelist/blacklist policy" ({@code UPSTREAM.md} #3, which is an offer to lift this upstream -- so keep
 * it liftable: no adapter types in its signatures, and no tson-java dependency beyond {@link TsonSchemaSource}).
 *
 * <h2>Identity is not location</h2>
 *
 * <p>[TSON-DATA] §2.2.1 keeps the two apart, and this class is built on that split. A reference's canonical
 * identity is its <b>lowercase host plus path</b> -- the scheme is "a transport hint, not part of the name", the
 * {@code ?sha256=} pin is verification metadata, and an identifying URI carries <b>no port, default or
 * otherwise</b>, no userinfo and no fragment. Identity exists to name a document "independent of its storage
 * location", and a consumer "MAY fetch by whichever scheme its policy allows".
 *
 * <p>So the two questions are separate, and are configured separately:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Which schema names will this server load?</b> {@link Builder#allowHost} -- the security boundary.</li>
 *   <li><b>Where does it fetch them from?</b> {@code https://<host>` + path} by default;
 *       {@link Builder#mapHost} points a host at another base for a mirror, an internal network, or a test,
 *       which is the only way to reach a non-default port, since an identity cannot carry one.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A mapped host does not rename anything: the loader still cross-checks that the fetched document's embedded
 * {@code !!id} is the identity that was asked for, so a mirror serving the wrong document fails rather than
 * substituting silently.
 *
 * <h2>The reference is attacker-controlled</h2>
 *
 * <p>A data document names its own schema (<code>!!schema:"https://…"</code>), so in a server the string reaching
 * {@link #fetch} came out of a request body. A source that fetches whatever it is handed is a server-side request
 * forgery primitive: it will read a cloud metadata endpoint, port-scan a private network, or follow a redirect
 * from a permitted host to one that isn't. Hence:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Deny by default.</b> No allowed host means nothing is fetched. A host is compared exactly -- there is
 *       no suffix or wildcard matching, because {@code .example.com} written as a suffix test also matches
 *       {@code evil-example.com}, which is how this control is usually defeated.</li>
 *   <li><b>The reference must be a legal identity</b> -- §2.2.1's own rule. A port, userinfo or fragment is
 *       refused here, with a message that says so, rather than failing further in with a stack trace.</li>
 *   <li><b>Redirects are never followed.</b> A redirect is the allow-list's exit door: the check happened on the
 *       identity, and the second hop is a different URI. A 3xx is a fetch failure.</li>
 *   <li><b>Size and time are capped</b>, and size is enforced against bytes delivered, never against
 *       {@code Content-Length}, which the origin also controls.</li>
 *   <li><b>Policy is checked on every reference, including a cached one.</b> A hit skips the network, never the
 *       allow-list.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>What this deliberately does not do</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>It does not verify the content hash, and it does not check the fetched document's {@code !!id}.</b> The
 * loader does both, after this returns: it verifies a reference's {@code ?sha256=} pin (§2.2.1's MUST-verify
 * rule) and cross-checks the embedded identity. Repeating either here would be a second implementation to drift
 * from the real one.
 *
 * <p>What the loader cannot express is <em>requiring</em> a pin, since it only verifies one that is present.
 * {@link Builder#requireContentHashPin} adds that, and it is the strongest control available against a permitted
 * host that is later compromised: with it on, only content the operator has already hashed is accepted.
 *
 * <h2>Caching and threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>Cached by canonical identity, so a varied query string cannot force repeated outbound fetches, and §3.5's
 * immutability rule makes the entry permanently valid. The cache is bounded; once full it stops accepting
 * entries rather than evicting, since a schema set is small and fixed in practice.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe. <b>That is not the same as it being safe to resolve a schema from a request
 * thread</b> -- resolution mutates the registry, which is not concurrent-safe, so a schema arriving at runtime
 * still needs external serialisation. {@link #preload} is the intended path: name the schemas at startup, on one
 * thread, and let request-time resolution find them already registered. See {@code CLAUDE.md}.
